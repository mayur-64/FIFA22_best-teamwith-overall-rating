# FIFA22_best-teamwith-overall-rating
The data have all players stats available in FIFA 22 game. We have created a function from which we can find the players with top rating suited in the respective formation. 

We have created a fucntion best_nation_team suited for 4-3-3 formation. We give nation name to the function and it will return a dataframe of 11 
players with highest rating player for the respective playing position.

Milestone 1 : We are workingto add more formation and compare the overall rating for the each formation, and hence best suited OR the team with highest rating will be returned.

Milestone 2 : We need to update the program so that an average age of the player will be given to the function and it will create a team with players having nearer age to the inpit age.

Milestone 3 : Adding one more parameter for sorting can be wages. as we know we highly posses for the team with least wage/salary. So we can add that parameter too in this.
